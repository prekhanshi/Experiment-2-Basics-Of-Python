# Experiment-2-Basics-Of-Python
AIM
To study the Python programming environment and interface, understand execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations in Python.

# THEORY:
1) Python Environment and Interface
The Python environment provides the required tools to write, execute, and debug Python programs. Python can be used through different interfaces such as the Python Shell, Jupyter Notebook, IDEs like Spyder/PyCharm/VS Code, and cloud platforms like Google Colab. These interfaces help the user to type code, run it, and view the output easily, making learning and development faster.

2) Python Execution Modes
Python supports two main execution modes:

Interactive Mode: In this mode, Python executes one command at a time and immediately shows the output. It is very useful for beginners and for testing small pieces of code quickly.

Script Mode: In this mode, the complete program is written in a file (usually with .py extension) and executed as a whole. This mode is used for writing full programs and applications.

3) Comments in Python
Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability. Python supports single-line comments using the hash symbol (#) and multi-line comments using triple quotes. Comments are important for documentation, understanding program flow, and maintaining code properly.

4) Variables and Identifiers
A variable is a named memory location used to store data values. Python allows dynamic typing, meaning we do not need to declare the datatype explicitly before storing values. Identifiers are names given to variables and must follow rules such as starting with a letter or underscore, not starting with digits, being case-sensitive, and not using Python reserved keywords.

5) Data Types in Python
Python provides built-in data types to store different types of values. Integer is used for whole numbers, float is used for decimal values, string is used for text, and boolean is used for True/False values. The datatype of any variable can be checked using the type function.

6) Operators and Expressions
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports various operators such as arithmetic operators for mathematical operations, relational operators for comparison, logical operators for combining conditions, assignment operators for assigning and updating values, and bitwise operators for operations at binary level. An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.

7) Basic Input and Output Operations
Input and output allow interaction between the user and the program. Python uses the input function to take user input, which is stored as a string by default. If required, the input can be converted into integer or float. The print function is used to display output on the screen, and formatted output can be displayed using commas or formatting techniques.

# CONCLUSION:
Thus, the Python programming environment, execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations were studied and understood.

# PROGRAM EXPLANATION:
Program 1: Comments and Execution Demonstration
This program explains how comments are written in Python using single-line and multi-line formats. It then prints simple messages on the screen to demonstrate how Python executes statements and displays output. The purpose is to understand that comments do not affect execution and are only meant for readability and documentation.

Program 2: Variables and Data Types
This program demonstrates how variables are created and assigned values in Python. It uses different kinds of values such as text, whole numbers, decimal numbers, and boolean values. It also displays the datatype of each variable to show how Python automatically assigns datatypes based on the stored value.

Program 3: Operators Demonstration
This program explains the working of different operators in Python. It performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also checks relational conditions like greater than and equality. Logical operators are used to combine conditions and produce True/False results. Assignment operators are shown by updating a variable value, and bitwise operators are demonstrated to show binary-level operations.

Program 4: Input and Output Formatting
This program takes input from the user such as name and marks. Since marks should be numeric, it converts the input into integer form. Finally, it displays the entered details using output statements. The main aim is to understand user interaction through input and output in Python.
